## User Stories Project 2

### Movie Recommendations
As a user I would like to see what movies are available to watch so that I can plan what I want to watch

### Favourite
As a user I would like to add the movies that I like the look of to my favourites so that I can watch them when I am ready

### Favourites
As a user I would like to be able to see all my favourited movies in one place so that it is easy for me to see all the movies I want to watch in one place

### Remove Button
As a user I would like to be able to remove movies that I no longer want to watch so that my favourites only consist of movies I want to watch

### Watched button
As a user I would like to be able to mark the movies that I have watched so that I know which ones I have watched and which ones I am yet to watch. 

### Remove all button
As a user I would like to be able to clear all the movies from my favourites so that I know that I no longer need to watch them.

### Remove watched
As a user I would like to be able to clear all my watched movies so that I can make room for more movies that I would like to watch
